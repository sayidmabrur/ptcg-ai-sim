"""``agent()`` entry point for the packaged submission — the behavioral-
cloning ``PolicyNetwork`` playing live.

This file is the submission's ``main.py``; ``make_submission.py`` copies it
under that name alongside everything it imports. It is kept separate from
the repo-root ``main.py`` (the random-baseline template) so the template
stays untouched and this stays diffable.

Two things about the competition harness shape the design:

*Only our own decisions are visible.* Offline, ``LiveFeatureExtractor`` is
driven with both players' frames — the duel loop feeds it every decision
from both sides. Here ``agent()`` is invoked only when it is our turn to
choose, so the opponent's individual decisions are never seen. The
extractor still works (it derives everything from the board state carried in
each ``obs``), but ``opponent_history`` becomes a diff between *our*
successive views of the opponent's board rather than one entry per opponent
decision. That is a genuine train/serve difference, not a bug that can be
fixed here — the information simply is not in the input. See the note in
``make_submission.py`` about validating against it.

*A crash forfeits the match.* Every failure path therefore falls back to a
legal random selection rather than propagating: a weak move scores far
better than no move.
