    """Load decision samples written by ``convert_replays.py`` and reshape them
    into the feature groups a policy network consumes.

    Each sample is ``(features, meta)`` for the observation, plus the target:
      - ``features["state"]``: the deciding player's own board (hand included).
      - ``features["opponent_state"]``: the opponent's board, same shape, hand
        redacted to ``None`` by the game engine already (only ``handCount``
        known).
      - ``features["global_state"]``: match-level context not scoped to
        either player (turn, stadium, energy/supporter-played flags, etc).
      - ``features["decision_context"]``: the selection being made and the
        options offered — only ever the deciding player's, never the
        opponent's.
      - ``features["opponent_history"]``: a list of per-turn diffs of the
        opponent's board over their last ``opponent_history_size`` turns
        (oldest first), built from the resulting board state after each of
        their turns — never their raw ``target_action``, since that's an
        internal option index the opponent never actually gets to observe
        about themselves; diffed against ``EMPTY_BOARD_STATE`` for their
        first captured turn so every entry has the same shape. The default
        ``opponent_history_size`` of 60 is above any realistic turn count, so
        it covers the whole match; pass 0 to switch the group off.
      - ``features["decision_chain"]``: this same actor's own last
        ``decision_chain_size`` decisions across the whole match (oldest
        first) — turn/selection/options/chosen target, since this is the
        actor's own past choices, not something being inferred about the
        opponent. The opponent's interleaved decisions are filtered out, not
        treated as a boundary, so this is purely the deciding player's
        history from their own perspective; each entry's ``turn`` says which
        turn it came from. Pass 0 to switch the group off.
      - ``meta``: bookkeeping only (``episode_id``, ``frame_index``,
        ``player_index``, ``player_name``) — everything is already reoriented
        to the deciding player's POV, so ``player_index`` is not a feature
        the model should condition on, only a raw-slot pointer for tracing
        rows back through an episode (e.g. building opponent history).

    The target is the list of option *indexes* selected by that player.  The
    index is local to ``features["decision_context"]["options"]``; it is not
    a card ID.

    ``player_name`` restricts the *samples* to one agent (or several) for
    imitation learning, so every target is a decision that agent actually
    made.  It does not restrict what the feature builders may read: the
    opponent's rows stay visible to the backward scans, since dropping them
    would erase the opponent's turns from ``opponent_history``.
